.SH NAME
mailq \- show contents of the mail queue
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B mailq
.SH DESCRIPTION
This is a link to the ssmtp binary. It invokes
.B /usr/sbin/sendmail
with the
.B -q
option. It is provided for compatibility with the sendmail program.
.P
In this case it does absolutely nothing since sSMTP does not support
mail queues and is just there to avoid programs returning error messages.
.SH AUTHOR
This manual page was written by Matt Ryan <mryan@@debian.org> for the
Debian GNU/Linux system.
