@ssmtp for DEBIAN
----------------

This is a secure, minimal mail sender.

There is one configuration file in /etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf where all parameters
are set. Support for debconf has been added, so to change the parameters use
the command "dpkg-reconfigure ssmtp".

Header size is limited to 4K. Do not try any mass mailings with this
package. Moreover the number of recipients is limited to 100.

sSMTP also supports reverse aliases if the file /etc/ssmtp/revaliases is
present. See ssmtp(8) for details.

This is basically a package that is abandoned. I have fixed it up so that
it works under Debian/GNU. Do not expect any upstream upgrades.

There is one configureation file in /etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf where all parameters
are set.
