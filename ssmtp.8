.SH DESCRIPTION
.I ssmtp
is a send-only sendmail emulator for machines which normally pick their mail
up from a centralized mailhub (via pop, imap, nfs mounts or other means).
It provides the functionality required for humans and programs to send
mail via the standard or /usr/bin/mail user agents.
.PP
It accepts a mail stream on standard input with recipients specified on the
command line and synchronously forwards the message to the mail transfer
agent of its mailhub for the mailhub MTA to process. Failed messages are
placed in dead.letter in the sender's home directory.
.PP
A config file allows one to specify the person to receive mail for root,
daemon, etc. One can also specify the mailhub's name and optionaly the domain
to be used in From: lines.
.sp
.PP
It does not attempt to provide all the functionality of sendmail: it is
intended for use where other programs are the primary means of at last mail
delivery.  It is usefull with pop/imap, or to simulate the Sun shared mail
spool option for non-Sun machines, for machines whose sendmails are too
difficult (or various) to configure, for machines with known disfeatures in
their sendmails or for ones where there are ``mysterious problems''. 
.PP
It does not do aliasing, which must be done either in the user agent
or on the mailhub. Nor does it honor .forwards, which have to be done
on the recieving host.  It especially does not deliver to pipelines.

.SH OPTIONS
Most sendmail options are irrelevent to sSMTP. Those marked ``ignored'' or
``default'' have no effect on mail transfer.  Those marked ``unsupported''
are fatal errors.  Those marked ``simulated'' are not errors, but the result
is for the program to exit with an informative message. A sort of fatal
non-error.

.SH REVERSE ALIASES
A reverse alias is used for out-going mails. If the From: line has not been
specified and if an entry exists for the user sending the mail, the From:
field is set to the value indicated in the revaliases file. Example:
.sp
.RS +.3i
.ta 1.0i
.nf
root: user@your.domain
.fi
.RE
.sp
Every mail sent by root will have a From: user@your.domain line in the header.
