@I am releasing version 2.36 without extensive testing. I do not use sSMTP
anymore, so it is difficult to do a good job as a maintainer.

Since I have received a few patches, I have applied them after having
reviewed them. However, I do not guarantee that they won't break
something.

If somebody wants to take over sSMTP's maintenance, please contact me.
